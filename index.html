<h4>The Fine Print</h4>
<p>Participation in physical recreation not required; picnicking and children encouraged; we’ll bring
some drinks and savory and sweet pies in honor of Alex’s 3/14 birthday–if you want to bring a pie too, that sort of thing is encouraged, but no pressure!</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h5><em>How do you play knockout?</em></h5>
<p>Don't worry, just scroll down to see <a href="#rules-of-knockout">the rules</a>.</p>
<h5><em>I want to play but my basketball skills make Mr Magoo look like Shaq, is that a problem?</em></h5>
<p>Not at all! The goal here is &quot;casual, fun game&quot;, not &quot;cutthroat competition&quot;, and you will not be alone.</p>
<h5><em>What if I am a literal NBA player?</em></h5>
<p>If you're <em>that</em> good, you'll have to start from three point distance instead of the free throw
line. Halfcourt if you're Damian Lillard. Also, can I have some tickets to the next game? As a
birthday present?</p>
<h2 id="rules-of-knockout">Rules of knockout</h2>
<ul>
<li>Everyone forms one line behind the cone a few feet behind the foul line, facing the basket.</li>
<li>The first two players in line get a ball.</li>
<li>The point of the game is for the second player to make a basket before the person in front of them.</li>
<li>The first player takes their first shot from the foul line.</li>
<li>As soon as the first player attempts the first shot, the second player may attempt a shot from the foul line.</li>
<li>If a player misses their first shot from the foul line, they may then rebound and shoot from anywhere on the court.</li>
<li>Both players are trying to be the first to make a basket.</li>
<li>If the second player makes it before the first player, the first player in line was &quot;knocked out.</li>
<li>Both players pass their balls to the front of the line and then walk to the end of the line.</li>
<li>If first player makes a basket first, the player second continues shooting.</li>
<li>The first layer passes the ball to the next person in line and goes to the end of the line.</li>
<li>The next person in line shoots a foul shot, now trying to a basket before the player still on the court.</li>
<li>Once a player scores or is knocked out they should pass their ball to the next person in line as quickly as possible.</li>
<li>Players can knock each other's basketballs with their own ball. This can only be done when the ball is in the air (not in another player's hands)</li>
